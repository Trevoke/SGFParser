TueurNe [11k?\]: bS17 -> wQ19 .. ko fight
TueurNe [11k?\]: see my picture .. I am a night predator ;)
Masterius [4k\]: :)
Masterius [4k\]: scary
Guyal27 [10k\]: hm..it does turn into a ko fight
Masterius [4k\]: no
Guyal27 [10k\]: one that white will win
Masterius [4k\]: bS17->wQ19->bR19->wS19->bT18
Masterius [4k\]: like that
TueurNe [11k?\]: guyal : don't forget that G13 is weak
Masterius [4k\]: wait sorry
Masterius [4k\]: that´s not good
Masterius [4k\]: well not sure
Masterius [4k\]: well I will go now
Masterius [4k\]: see you later bye
Guyal27 [10k\]: i played out
Guyal27 [10k\]: if white wins that ko
Guyal27 [10k\]: then it's almost a perfectly even game
JOC [16k\]: yeah white is not unconditionally dead up there right ?
Namishere [12k\]: looks like he is
Namishere [12k\]: if w defends those two whites stones
JOC [16k\]: how ?
Namishere [12k\]: b cuts at n16
Namishere [12k\]: and b liberties more than w group
Namishere [12k\]: I think
JOC [16k\]: w blocks with o15
JOC [16k\]: then ?
Namishere [12k\]: o15?
TueurNe [11k?\]: if black cut at N16, white play O19 and win the capture race
JOC [16k\]: o16 sorry
Namishere [12k\]: yeah
JOC [16k\]: tueurne exactly
Namishere [12k\]: will play around with it offline
JOC [16k\]: i already tried basically all variations :)
JOC [16k\]: but i guess some higher rated players migth find something
Namishere [12k\]: w needs to cut at n19 too
Namishere [12k\]: would be a fun fight....
JOC [16k\]: namishere there's still not enough liberties
Namishere [12k\]: hmmm
Namishere [12k\]: try n16
Namishere [12k\]: n19
Namishere [12k\]: m17-19
Namishere [12k\]: for b moves
JOC [16k\]: then white just m16 
JOC [16k\]: after n16 -> o16 
JOC [16k\]: so n16 is in atari
JOC [16k\]: w has to block n19 tho
JOC [16k\]: but it's still enough room
Namishere [12k\]: hmmm
Namishere [12k\]: with n16 in atari
Namishere [12k\]: w needs to move m19 in response to n16
Namishere [12k\]: *sorry, before response*
Namishere [12k\]: hmmm
JOC [16k\]: ?
Namishere [12k\]: oh well
Namishere [12k\]: ask a higher level player, I guess
JOC [16k\]: m19 in response to n19 you mean
Namishere [12k\]: yeah
JOC [16k\]: yo
Namishere [12k\]: double atari for b then
JOC [16k\]: so white should live after p16 :P
Namishere [12k\]: hmmm
Namishere [12k\]: hehe, okay
JOC [16k\]: s17 s19 seems to be the killing sequence :P
IamBad [5k?\]: stranges game :)
