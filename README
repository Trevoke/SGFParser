Example:
require 'sgf_parser'
tree = SGF::Tree.new :filename => File
tree = SGF::Tree.new :sgf_string => String

Now works with KGS files; should work with all FF4 SGF files.
Should also work with Ruby from 1.8.6 and up, though untested with anything
earlier than 1.8.7.
Fixed my 'each' command, which was broken.

Now to make the files savable..

The next nodes are in an array. Node.next will return an array.
For the next node in the main branch, use Node.next_main.
Yes, it's just Node.next[0] but it's prettier, isn't it?
.. Okay, okay. I'm working on it.
