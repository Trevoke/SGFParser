Example:
require 'sgf_parser'
tree = SGFTree.new :filename => File
tree = SGFTree.new :sgf_string => String

Now works with KGS files; should work with all FF4 SGF files.
Should also work with Ruby from 1.8.6 and up, though untested with anything
earlier than 1.8.7.
Fixed my 'each' command, which was broken.

Now to make the files savable..

The next nodes are in an array, so even if there's only one next node,
it's next[0]. If you have better ideas.. Let me know or fork :)
